    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: December 29, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Key Summary:</strong> HeartRate Senior is designed with your privacy as the top priority. <strong>We do not upload your health data to any servers.</strong> All heart rate measurements and processing are performed locally on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how HeartRate Senior (the "App") collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to minimize data usage. We collect the following types of data, which are stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Data:</strong> Heart rate measurements calculated via the camera.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous logs for crash reporting (if enabled by iOS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. HealthKit Integration</h2>
    <p>HeartRate Senior integrates with Apple's HealthKit framework to sync your heart rate data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read Access:</strong> We request permission to read heart rate data to display your history.</li>
        <li><strong>Write Access:</strong> We request permission to save new measurements to the Health app.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> share your HealthKit data with any third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. All HealthKit data remains on your device or in your personal iCloud (if enabled).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>The App uses your device's camera and flash solely for the purpose of detecting blood flow changes in your fingertip (PPG technology) to calculate your heart rate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Images or video frames processed for measurement are analyzed in real-time memory and are <strong>never saved or transmitted</strong>.</li>
        <li>The camera is never used when the app is in the background.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>All personal health data is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage technologies (SwiftData/CoreData).</p>
    <p>If you have iCloud enabled, your data may sync across your own Apple devices. This is managed entirely by Apple, and we do not have access to your iCloud account.</p>

    <h2>6. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This App is <strong>not a medical device</strong>. The data collected is for fitness and wellness purposes only. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Always consult a physician for any health concerns.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically. Significant changes will be notified within the App. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:developer@moonspace.work">developer@moonspace.work</a></p>
